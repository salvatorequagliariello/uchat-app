## Overview
Developed with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [NuxtJS](https://nuxt.com/), and written [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), uChat offers a powerful, efficient and free platform for users to chat with their friends and loved ones. With its sleek and modern design, styled with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), uChat provides an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user experience. 

uChat's authentication system is custom-made. This ensures a secure and personalized login experience for users. By leveraging the power of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), uChat securely stores user data, providing peace of mind and easy access to information.

Users can add their friends by simply searching for their user name in the dedicated search bar.
